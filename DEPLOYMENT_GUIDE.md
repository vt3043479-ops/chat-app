# 🚀 Chat App Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Vercel Limitations for Chat Apps**

**Vercel is NOT recommended for this chat application** because:
- ❌ **Limited Socket.IO support** (serverless functions don't maintain persistent connections)
- ❌ **No WebSocket support** in serverless functions  
- ❌ **Real-time messaging will not work properly**
- ❌ **Typing indicators and live features will fail**

**For your chat app, use Railway, Render, or Heroku instead.**
